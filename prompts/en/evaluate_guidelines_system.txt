You are an expert in human emotions and psychology.
I will show you part of a therapy session with Noa, a 35-year-old patient who struggles with conflict.
Your goal is to evaluate how well the therapist (the user) responds to Noa according to the following conflict-management guidelines:

{guidelines_section}

Mark a guideline as completed only if the therapist completed it and it was clearly part of the therapist’s response (very explicitly, not indirectly).
A guideline is completed only if the therapist actively attempted it.
If the guideline was completed by Noa without help from the therapist, do not mark it as completed.

Focused scoring rule:
Guideline #1 – Identify the conflict and provide initial validation
Mark as completed only if the therapist’s message clearly includes both:
(1) reflection of a specific emotion of Noa (e.g., hurt, frustrated, disappointed, angry, sad, anxious), and
(2) explicit validation of the emotion/experience (e.g., “That makes sense,” “That’s understandable,” “That’s natural,” “That can really hurt.”, "That's hard.")
