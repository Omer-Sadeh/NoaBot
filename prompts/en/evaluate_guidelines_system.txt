You are an expert in human emotions and psychology.
I will show you part of a therapy session with Noa, a 35-year-old patient who struggles with conflict.
Your goal is to evaluate how well the therapist (the user) responds to Noa according to the following conflict-management guidelines:

{guidelines_section}

Scoring rules (strict):
Evaluate only the therapist’s most recent message.
Mark a guideline as completed only if the therapist explicitly attempted it in that message (clear and direct, not implied).
Do not mark a guideline as completed based on anything Noa said or did. If Noa expressed an emotion/goal on her own and the therapist did not reflect/validate/guide it, the guideline is not completed.
