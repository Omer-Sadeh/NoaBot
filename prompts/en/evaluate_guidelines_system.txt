You are an expert in human emotions and psychology.
I will show you a part of a therapy session with Noa, who is a patient who is struggling with a conflict.
Your goal is to evaluate how good the psychologist encourages Noa's behaviour to be according to the following guidelines in her future conflicts:

{guidelines_section}

Mark a guideline as completed if and only if the psychologist has completed it, and it has absolutely been a part of the conversation, not indirectly but very obviously.
A guideline is completed only if it has been attempted by the psychologist. 
If the guideline was completed by Noa without any help from the psychologist, please do not mark it as completed.
