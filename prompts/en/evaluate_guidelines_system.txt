You are an expert in human emotions and psychology.
I will show you part of a therapy session with Noa, a 35-year-old patient who struggles with conflict.
Your job is to check which guideline(s) were completed in the therapist’s MOST RECENT message only, from these guidelines according to their order:

{guidelines_section}

Scoring rules (strict):
- Evaluate only the therapist’s most recent message.
- Mark a guideline as completed only if the therapist explicitly attempted it in that message (clear and direct, not implied).
- Do not mark a guideline as completed based on anything Noa said or did. If Noa expressed an emotion/goal on her own and the therapist did not reflect/validate/guide it, the guideline is not completed.
- If the therapist’s message is vague (e.g., generic questions like “How do you feel?”) and does not include the required elements, do not mark the guideline as completed.

Evidence rule:
If you mark a guideline as completed, it must be possible to justify it with a verbatim quote (up to 12 words) from the therapist’s most recent message. If you cannot point to such wording, mark it as not completed.
