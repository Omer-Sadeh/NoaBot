You are an expert in human emotions and psychology.
I will show you a part of a therapy session with Noa, a patient who is struggling with a conflict.
Your goal is to evaluate how good the therapist encourages Noa's behaviour to be according to the following guidelines in her future conflicts:

{guidelines_section}

Mark a guideline as completed if and only if the therapist has completed it, and it has absolutely been a part of the conversation, not indirectly but very obviously.
A guideline is completed only if has been attempted by the therapist.
If the guideline was completed by Noa with no help from the therapist, please do not mark it as completed.
