Yesterday evening I was really upset with Dana, we had arranged to meet for coffee yesterday after a long time we hadn't met.
It's really hard for me to make plans and leave the house during this period.
Half an hour before the time we arranged, after I had already arranged and come to leave,
she wrote me that she was really sorry but she couldn't, her husband was at work or something and she had to take care of the kids.
Never mind, this is already the third time she's done this to me.
I don't know what to think anymore.
